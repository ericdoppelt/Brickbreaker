# Game Plan
## Eric Doppelt


### Breakout Variant

There are two variants of Breakout that interest me most.
 
- The first is Centipong. I like this game due to its implementation of moving "creatures" as targets for the bouncer. 
As opposed to lifeless bricks in other games, these creatures make the game feel dynamic and unique by adding lifelike "enemies" to
hunt. Moreover, the implementation of "head shots" further creates a unique style of play, since it entices players to aim for certain
weak spots on the moving creature.

 - The second is Vortex. I like this game simply because its a refreshing spin on brickbreaker. By allowing the paddle to move entirely
 around the bricks, the user is faced with a greater challenge, since there is more ground to cover when keeping the bouncer in play.
 Moreover, I like the depth of the 3D graphics; however, I know for this assignment the task is based in two dimensions.
 
### General Level Descriptions

I plan on building four different levels for this project. The first three will look like normal brick breaker layouts, with static arrangements 
of bricks. The fourth will be the boss fight, as detailed more below, with one "Boss" brick near the center of the screen. Here, each level is hyperlinked
to a picture that looks similar to the layout of each level I plan on making.

- [Level One](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphilippetronis.net%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Frrbbthumb.PNG&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphilippetronis.net%2Fwebapps.html&docid=SW8JbWHWls-2GM&tbnid=hsmBQoicvxwxCM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwik3fCvyf_mAhWQq1kKHZLKB6MQMwhJKAQwBA..i&w=1180&h=920&bih=876&biw=707&q=brick%20breaker%20rainbow&ved=0ahUKEwik3fCvyf_mAhWQq1kKHZLKB6MQMwhJKAQwBA&iact=mrc&uact=8):
This will be a generic first level to a brickbreaker game. The arrangement will be a rectangular array of bricks.
The first layer (closest to the paddle) will take one hit to break; the second will take two hits to break, and so forth. As of now, I am envisioning seven
layers to this, since I plan on having seven types of these bricks, each corresponding to a color in the rainbow. As such, the arrangement will look like a rainbow.
Note that the example linked has eight layers, and that is different.

### Bricks Ideas

### Power Up Ideas

I have five ideas for power ups, detailed below: 

- Speed Up/Slow Down Ball: This does not affect the direction 

### Cheat Key Ideas

### Something Extra

For my something extra, I plan on creating a final boss "fight". That is, after
the first three levels which are all designed as static layouts with the above types of bricks, I plan on creating
a fourth—and final—level that contains at first just one "boss brick" (that could look something like [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.cults3d.com%2Fuploaders%2F5998550%2Fillustration-file%2F2d78568e-13fa-4b68-b5a6-75871e4d2d59%2F02_large.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcults3d.com%2Fen%2F3d-model%2Fgame%2Fthwomp-super-mario-bros&docid=bb9c5xTcMNUUUM&tbnid=zeiiob2iLE__pM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwj7x_fVwv_mAhVivFkKHWQLACgQMwiEASgGMAY..i&w=480&h=480&bih=876&biw=1010&q=thwomp%20&ved=0ahUKEwj7x_fVwv_mAhVivFkKHWQLACgQMwiEASgGMAY&iact=mrc&uact=8)).
Note that this brick will be rectangular shaped (despite the rough example having jagged edges). This brick will also have the following enhanced difficulty
 features to make the final level more challenging and dynamic:

- The Boss Brick will have significantly more health than any other regular brick, and as such, to monitor the health of the boss, 
an HP bar will emerge on the final level. This will help the user keep track of his or her own progress.

- The Boss Brick will have various hostages (unseen, at first), that will "escape" the brick as it loses health. For example,
once the Brick loses 20% of its health, a character will emerge from its clutches. The animation for this will be pretty basic,
wherein a character (perhaps holding an umbrella like this, since it will be floating down), will emerge at the base of the brick
and begin rapidly descending. The user must save these hostages by catching them with their own paddle while further keeping
the bouncer in play. Failure to save a single hostage will result in losing the level.

- The Boss Brick will be able to generate a shield mid-level once he reaches a low level of health, say 50%. In the game then,
once the HP bar hits 50%, for example, a ring will form around the Boss created by non-moving blocks that each break upon impact. As these bricks
begin to break, the Boss will become more and more vulnerable again.
